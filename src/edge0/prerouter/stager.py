"""Prerouter step-boundary stager.

After each forward's logits eval, run every owner head as ONE stacked
batch (the base graph is already materialized), turn the logits into
expert selections with ONE eval + ONE tolist, and submit the next
decode step's staged slots per consumer layer — so the pool's SSD
builds overlap the next forward entirely (no per-layer sync points
inside the graph).

Two feature/consume conventions exist across the supported models, both
implemented here:

* qwen (``CrossTokenStager``): heads installed on the MoE blocks, the
  block patch captures ``(m_in, executed one-hot)``; the stager makes
  the selection itself (precise softmax -> top-k -> renormalize) and
  stores ``pred_inds`` / ``pred_scores`` keyed by the consuming layer.
* ling (``LingPrerouterStager``): heads baked into the vendored model,
  features read from the model's own caches (``m_in_cache`` /
  ``last_topk`` teacher feature / ``prev_topk_oh``); the stager stores
  the raw LOGITS in ``pg_cache`` and the consuming MoE block performs
  the sigmoid group-limited selection internally.
