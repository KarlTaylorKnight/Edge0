"""CUDA backend: model / tokenizer / tensor-store loading.

Contract (documented): ``load_model, load_tokenizer, open_tensor_store``.
Two more names are used in practice by call sites that import
``edge0.backends.mlx.io`` DIRECTLY instead of going through the generic
facade -- ``load_safetensors`` (``prerouter/install.py``,
``adapters/lora.py``) and ``open_shards`` (``engine/qwen.py``). Those
call sites need editing to import from ``edge0.backends.io`` once a
backend is selected; until then this module still implements both so
the CUDA-side equivalents exist and are testable on their own.

      gets swapped out by the streaming installer instead. No key

      SECURITY NOTE, not a footnote: ``trust_remote_code=True`` runs
      third-party Python shipped inside the checkpoint directory. That
