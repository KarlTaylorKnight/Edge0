"""Streaming layer options.

One ``LayerOptions`` instance describes the streaming behavior of one MoE
layer (all layers usually share one instance).  This is the typed
replacement for the deployment's env-var knobs; profiles (see
``edge0.models``) pick the option sets for a given tier.

Defaults reproduce the deployment's production behavior for the edge0-35b
K=4 tier (staged decode on, sync fills, hot pins on prefill).

class LayerOptions:
    """Options for one streaming MoE layer.

    Attributes:
        staged: enable fixed-slot staged decode (routing through staged
            slots with zero per-layer host syncs).
        staged_replace: staged set REPLACES the router (routing set ==
            staged set; used with a prerouter head — no drops).
        staged_n: number of staged slots.
        staged_trigger: router top-k that activates the staged path
            (usually the routed top_k).
        staged_sync: fill staged slots synchronously at the step boundary
            (as opposed to purely async double-buffered fills).
        asm_cache: cache assembled (slot table, stacked-wargs) per staged
            expert set so repeated sets don't rebuild graph nodes.
        incr_stack: incremental sticky-slot stack (in-place row writes
            instead of re-stacking; sync staged mode only).
        incr_writeback: write evicted bundles back into the shared LRU
            (dedups the staged set from the LRU while staged).
        history_prefetch: prefetch the union of recent actual expert sets.
        hot_per_layer: resident hot-expert pins per layer (0 disables).
        hot_update_interval: refresh hot pins every N forward calls.
        hot_decay: decay factor for hot-expert usage counts.
        pin_bonus: extra score for prerouter-predicted experts when
            selecting hot pins.
        cache_slots: shared LRU capacity across all layers.
        prefetch_cap: prefetch buffer capacity.
        max_inflight: per-layer bound on QUEUED speculative prefetch
            builds (None = unbounded, the historical behavior).  Demand
            loads are never dropped; a memory budget sets this so the
            producer queue cannot outrun the priced-in transient.
        predict_prefetch: route each step's prerouter predictions into
            ``prefetch()`` for NON-staged layers (the prod profiles),
            overlapping next-step expert builds with the current
            forward.  Scheduling only: consumption stays on the exact
            ``_get_bundles`` path (late/wrong predictions fall back to
            demand loads; no staged zero rows).  Default off — on the
            Orin the unoptimized decode is compute-bound and the
            measured end-to-end benefit was below noise (see
            docs/plans/jetson-orin-nano.md Task 5); revisit once the
            Task 6 kernel work shrinks compute.
        load_threads: threads for on-demand expert builds.
        prefetch_threads: threads for eager prefetch builds.
        use_compile: wrap the MoE math in ``mx.compile``.
        top_k: override the resident block's routed top-k (both prefill
            and decode); None leaves the model config value.
        full_layer_prefill: whole-layer load-drop prefill (E3b).
        prefill_full_layers: number of LEADING layers that get whole-layer
            loads (N*~310MB of page cache for qwen); 0 = every layer.
        prefill_hot: resident hot-stack size used during prefill
            (0 disables the hot-stack path).
